# Xinij

I used to play the game Xonix over 30 years ago.

I rewrote it in JavaScript.

## Play it

Play it here: [Xinij](https://tomontheinternet.com/xinij/)

## Host it

You can load this game on your own website by adding the following code to your HTML:

```html
<div id="xinij"></div>
<script src="https://tomontheinternet.com/++/xinij.js"></script>
```
